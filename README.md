### Introducing myself ###

  As a curious person, I've always studied interesting topics in different areas, such as technology, psychology, medicine, pop culture, indie artists, theater, music, video shooting and editing, photography, leadership.
  Creating with a bigger purpose is a need for a person like me. Writing code and understanding how to contribute to enhancing livelihood conditions on Earth really gets me going.


### Previous Study and Career Path ###

  I have a license degree in Theater from UDESC (Santa Catarina State University), a renowned public university in Brazil. Although I consider the experiences and learnings from this graduate course as being irreplaceable, I realized it was not the career I was really passionate about. During this time, I was also creating videos for two YouTube channels. I learned to edit video with free online courses, and released over 100 videos on a channel that reached over 25k subscribers and 4.4 million views. 
  Even though I was not in a particular design school, what I've learned online and trained as a solo video creator got me an internship at a NGO called Politize back in 2018. The experience in this NGO lasted for over a year, and it was my first time collaborating with an incredibly hard-working and dedicated team. Working together with a high quality team helped me develop many soft skills that I was lacking.
  After some consideration on job satisfaction and income, I decided to return video creation to a hobby-like activity to explore myself artistically and relax, instead of turning it into my main source of income.


### Current Study and New Career Path ###

  As of april 2021, I have embraced the path to a career in the technology field. I'm learning about the different companies, the different working positions and, of course, the hard skills required to deliver the most value I can to the projects I contribute with.
  I'm studying Python and loving every single part of it, especially its clean syntax. I uploaded to the data science repository 4 different Data Science projects that I've built with the help of online teachers, so you can check them out. I learned to use tools like Jupyter Notebook, libraries like pandas, pyautogui, pyperclip, plotly, plotly_express, seaborn, matplotlib.pyplot, numpy, selenium's webdriver, sklearn.model_selection's train_test_split, sklearn.linear_model's LinearRegression, sklearn.ensemble's RandomForestRegressor and sklearn's metrics to automate tasks such as collect, clean and analyze data from .csv files and webpages to create prediction selling models and send updated financial reports to a customized email account.
   I'm also in touch with close mentors that help me guide my studying strategies and career path. I keep studying Python and Data Science, but am also studying from free online courses with CrashCourse's YouTube channel. I'm about to start a HTML and front-end basics course from Udemy. 
   I'm looking forward to learning and applying the hard skills in a great company.
